## The problem

There is a direct correlation between the income, skill level, and broadband subscription rate for areas that have access to broadband internet. The higher the subscription rate for an area translates a higher graduation and post-secondary education rate, higher median income, and a higher rated skill level. With organizations such as Caterpillar and the University of Georgia, Athens requires a deep pool of educated, highly skilled workers to fill open positions. We believe that by finding a solution to provide low or no cost broadband internet access to low-income areas in Athens, we can improve the overall quality of life and economic prospects for populations living in those areas.

## Our proposed solution

There are many moving parts to consider when attacking this issue: governmental oversight and easements, Internet service provider (ISP) cooperation, crimes of opportunity, economic feasibility, etc. We propose a pilot program using Section 8 government assisted housing combining cooperation from local and state governments as well as ISPs and local non-profits to roll out a technological solution that also incorporates job and computer specific training.
