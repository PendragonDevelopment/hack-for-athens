# Adopt a Connection

## Questions that need answered:

* How do we get buy-in from Charter, AT&T, et al?
* Once we have a broadband connection, how do we share it? 
* How much bandwidth can we realistically get away with? Between how many people?
* How do we make the prospect of supporting someone else's Internet connection attractive to businesses and individuals?
* How do we screen volunteers to help with the weekly/monthly maintenance?
