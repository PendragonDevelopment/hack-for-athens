# Mi-fi from the Library
## Questions that need answered:

* Would we require buy-in from Verizon, AT&T, Sprint (violation of ToS?)?
* How would the data plans be managed? And by whom?
* What can we expect in terms of hardware loss/damage?
* What stipulations would the Library impose on the program (accepting the library ToS for their computers on site)?
* Compatibility with older computers (possibly from Free IT Athens)?
