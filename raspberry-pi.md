# Raspberry Pi
## Questions that need answered:

* How do we connect out to the Internet?
* Is there a way around the AUPs without getting prior approval from the ISPs?
* Can we make the solution plug and play?
* How much will cost to make a node that's zero-config (or very nearly)?
* How much bandwidth can we realistically get away with? Between how many people?
* What other legal implications might there be (liability, COPPA, etc)?
