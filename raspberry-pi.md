# Raspberry Pi
## Questions that need answered:

* How do we connect out to the Internet? 
	- Using the broadband connection of local businesses and other community organisations (churches, schools, etc)

* Is there a way around the AUPs without getting prior approval from the ISPs?
	- Ginny from FourAthens says yes. We can apply political pressure and negotiate for more favorable terms.
* Can we make the solution plug and play?
	- Using Raspberry Pi, we can create a plug and play wireless router
* How much will cost to make a node that's zero-config (or very nearly)?
* How much bandwidth can we realistically get away with? Between how many people?
* What other legal implications might there be (liability, COPPA, etc)?
